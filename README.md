# budapest-real-estate-price-prediction

This repository contains code for analyzing and modeling real estate data from Budapest. The Jupyter Notebook file price_prediction_real_estate_budapest.ipynb is an interactive document created using Google Colab.

Overview
The notebook covers various steps involved in data analysis and modeling, including:

1 Importing essential libraries.

2 Loading and inspecting data.

3 Data preprocessing, including handling room information, district information, price and area conversion, and balcony information.

4 Geographical analysis, including calculating distances to the river and classifying properties based on their proximity to the river.

5 Data cleaning, including removing rows with missing values and dropping unnecessary columns.

6 Data splitting into training and testing datasets.

7 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), including visualizations such as histograms and correlation heatmap.

8 Feature engineering, including log transformation and creating dummy variables for categorical features.

10 Model training using Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and hyperparameter tuning for the Random Forest model.

11 Model evaluation.
